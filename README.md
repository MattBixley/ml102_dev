## Workshop

This workshop consists of a series of notebooks, adapted from the [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials):

1. [Introduction](notebooks/01_introduction.ipynb)
1. [Image classification](notebooks/02_classification.ipynb) ([source](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification))
1. [Transfer learning and fine-tuning](notebooks/03_transfer_learning.ipynb) ([source](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning))
1. [Slurm jobs on REANNZ GPUs](notebooks/04_slurm_jobs.ipynb)

We have already made a copy of these notebooks for you in the folder:

```
/home/$USER/ml102_workshop/
```

where `$USER` stands for your NeSI username.

You can also find them on GitHub: https://github.com/nesi/ml102_workshop

## Supplemental material

We also created or adapted the following notebooks.
We won't use them during the workshop.

- [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](notebooks/cnn.ipynb) example ([source](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn))
- [Image Segmentation](notebooks/segmentation.ipynb) ([source](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation))

## Appendix

- [Generate a Jupyter kernel for the workshop](KERNEL.md) (for maintainers)

    - If you want to create a new kernel for the workshop, new instructions need to be written for OOD.

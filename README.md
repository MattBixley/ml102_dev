# ML102 - Image analysis

This is an online workshop that will use Jupyter on NeSI.
Attendees will be required to set up an account on NeSI in order to participate. 
Full instructions will be sent to registrants closer to the time of the workshop.

## Workshop

This workshop consists of a series of notebooks, adapted from the [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials):

1. [Introduction](notebooks/01_introduction.ipynb)
2. [CNN](notebooks/02_cnn.ipynb) ([source](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn))
3. [Classification](notebooks/03_classification.ipynb) ([source](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification))
4. [Transfer learning](notebooks/04_transfer_learning.ipynb) ([source](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning))
5. [Segmentation](notebooks/05_segmentation.ipynb) ([source](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation))
6. [Slurm jobs on NeSI GPUs](notebooks/06_slurm_jobs.ipynb)

We have already made a copy of these notebooks for you in the folder:

```
/nesi/project/nesi99991/ml102_20220616/$USER
```

where `$USER` stands for your NeSI username.

We will now show you how to navigate in the Jupyter interface to find them.

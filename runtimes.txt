02_CNN - 8 Minutes
compile and train 10 epochs, 30s/epoch (5 minutes)
can be done as the example with 3 epochs, plot doesn't matter, fix the accuracy value if using 3, which is ~65%

03_Classification - 25 minutes
train 10 epochs, 48s/epoch - NEED TO RUN THESE to discuss deviation from expected/overfitting
retrain 15 epochs 52s - can likely cut to 10, add plot of predicition image, run the code and go back and discuss while running

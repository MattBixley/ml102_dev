    "### Workshop Notes  \n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop Notebooks come from the [TensorFlow Tutorials](www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/). TensorFlow and Keras provide great tools for building ML skills, particularly in the area of image analysis. It's Python Based, opensource, has lots of worked examples in the tutorials and generally provides a good balance between getting going and being able to build some useful models.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) also has a set of [Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) is slightly more Python heavy in its code base, but essentially provides the same ability to rapidly build ML models and BOTH are supported on the REANNZ Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Neural Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is a type of machine learning model inspired by the way biological brains process information. It's essentially a system of mathematical functions that take input data, process it through interconnected layers of \"neurons,\" and produce outputs.\n",
    "A neural network is made of: neurons, connections and layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neuron is a simple computational unit, which takes a number of input values, applies a weight (importance factor), typically adds a bias (adjustment term), and then passes the result through an activation function (which introduces non-linearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "![A neuron](../images/neuron.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Layers are split into input, hidden and output layers. The input layer combines the raw data. \n",
    "There can be many hidden layers -- these interface to the input layer and apply transformations by combining and recombining information. The last, output layer \n",
    "produces the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A neural network with 3 hidden layers](../images/neural_network.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Convolutional Neural Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs (or features) of a neural network can be anything. For instance, they can be the \n",
    "length of a bird's beak, the weight of the bird, etc. In a dense neural network, \n",
    "each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. This can be computationally expensive and also prone to over fitting when there are many neurons.  \n",
    "When working with images, the features are the pixels of each image and each image can have millions of pixels. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of sparse neural network where only neighbouring pixels combine by applying a convolution kernel. The same \n",
    "kernel (also known as filter) is moved over the entire image and this enforces \n",
    "translational invariance. CNNS also take advantage of the hierarchical nature of data to assemble patterns of complexity using smaller and simpler patterns embedded in their \n",
    "layers.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are three types of layers in Convolutional Neural Networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Convolutional Layer: In a typical neural network each input neuron is connected to the next hidden layer. In a CNN, only a small region of the input layer neurons connect to the neuron hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Pooling Layer: The pooling layer is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map. There will be multiple activation & pooling layers inside the hidden layer of the CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Fully-Connected layer: Fully Connected Layers form the last few layers in the network. The input to the fully connected layer is the output from the final Pooling or Convolutional Layer, which is flattened and then fed into the fully connected layer.\n",

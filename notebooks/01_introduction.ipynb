    "Convolutional Neural Networks are specialized for applications in image & video recognition. CNN is mainly used in image analysis tasks like Image recognition, Object detection & Segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of layers in Convolutional Neural Networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Convolutional Layer: In a typical neural network each input neuron is connected to the next hidden layer. In CNN, only a small region of the input layer neurons connect to the neuron hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Pooling Layer: The pooling layer is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map. There will be multiple activation & pooling layers inside the hidden layer of the CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Fully-Connected layer: Fully Connected Layers form the last few layers in the network. The input to the fully connected layer is the output from the final Pooling or Convolutional Layer, which is flattened and then fed into the fully connected layer.\n",
